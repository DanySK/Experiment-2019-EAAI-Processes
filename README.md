# Alchemist Primer

## Basic Setup for the Alchemist Simulator

This is a template project to spawn projects using the Alchemist Simulator.
It provides a pre-configured gradle build.
Simulations can be included in the `src/main/yaml` folder,
and executed via the `runAll` Gradle task.

For each YAML file in `src/main/yaml` a task `runFileName` will be created.
